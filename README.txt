# VALLORANT-Deathmatch-Bot
This is a fully automatic XP farming bot for VALLORANT Deathmatch. All written in Python, and available in executable  form.

USAGE:
1. Open VALLORANT
2. Make sure you window is set to fullscreen, the bot is screen based
3. Go to "Deathmatch", but don't click play
4. Run the bot
5. Go back to VALLORANT, and let it farm

You can press F1 to pause the farm, and F2 to stop it. The GUI also gives basic information about how the farm is doing (in beta).

The simplest way to run the bot is by looking in the "dist" folder for the executable, and running it.
Otherwise, you can use Python 3.78 (version it was designed in) and install the modules:
1. tkinter
2. keyboard
3. pyautogui
This gives you more control in the settings section of the "DeathmatchBoy.py" file.
